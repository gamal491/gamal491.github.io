<p>
Clock by the Gallon is an abstract visualization of time through fluid ounces of water. As someone who prioritizes fitness and a healthy lifestyle, I made it a goal of mine to drink 1 gallon of water a day, or 128 fluid ounces. 
Through this experiemental clock study, I aim to keep track of how much water I am drinking throughout the day and simultaneously motive others to drink their water. 
</p>
<p>
The water level starts at the top of the screen at 12:00:00 AM and minimizes by each second of the day, until there is no more blue left on the screen (I finished my gallon of water.) 
To create this, each hour, minute, and second are mapped in live time.
