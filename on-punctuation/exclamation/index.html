    <p>Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks,</p>
    <p>they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use,</p> 

    <p>if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question.</p>
        
    <p>The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible 
       to use question marks and quotation marks and <b>exclamation points</b> and now anybody sees it that way.</p> 
        
    <p>Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.</p>
