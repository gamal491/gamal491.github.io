    <p> <b class="red">Exclamation marks</b> have the same difficulty and also quotation marks,</p>
    <p>they are <a class="italicize-red">unnecessary</a>, they are <a class="italicize-red">ugly</a>, they <a class="italicize-red">spoil</a> the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use,</p> 

    <p>if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question.</p>
        
    <p>The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply <a class="italicize-red">impossible</a>
       to use question marks and quotation marks and <span class="question">exclamation</span> points</b> and now anybody sees it that way.</p> 
        
    <p>Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.</p>
