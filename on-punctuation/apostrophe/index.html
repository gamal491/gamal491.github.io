    <p>One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the <b>apostrophe</b> for possession.</p>

    <p>Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case 
    apostrophe has a <i>gentle tender</i> insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it.</p>

    <p>One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having 
    regrets and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like it and leaving 
    it out I feel no regret, there it is <i>unnecessary</i> and not ornamental but inside a word and its well perhaps, 
    perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness.</p>

    <p>At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. 
    I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in.</p>
