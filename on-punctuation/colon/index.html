    <p>When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do feel that it should go on 
        but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on 
        and on and if writing should go on what had <b>colons</b> and <b>commas</b> to do with it, what had periods to do 
        with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that 
        time the most profound need I had in connection with writing. What had colons and semi-colons to do with 
        it what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with it. </p>
