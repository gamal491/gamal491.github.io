    <p>What had <b class="pink">periods</b> to do with it.</p>
    <p>Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again <span>stop</span> sometime 
        and if one had to again and again <span>stop</span> sometime and if one had to again and again <span>stop</span> some time then periods had to exist. Beside I had always like 
        the look of periods and I liked what they did.<span> Stopping</span>  sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only 
        something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never <span>stopped </span>using them.</p>
    <p>Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence <a class="italicize-pink"> breaking up things </a>in arbitrary ways, that has happened lately with me in a poem 
        I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years ago periods had come to have 
        for me completely a life of their own. They could begin to act as they thought best and one might  <a class="italicize-pink">interrupt one's writing </a>with them that is not really interrupt 
        one's writing with them but one could come to<span> stop</span> arbitrarily<span> stop </span>at times in one's writing and so they could be used and you could use them Periods could come 
        to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own. They  <a class="italicize-pink">did not serve you in any servile way </a>as commas and colons and semi-colons do. 
        Yes you do feel what I mean.</p>
