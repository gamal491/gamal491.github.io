    <p>Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the <b class="yellow">question mark</b>. </p>

    <p> The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as <a class="italicize">a brand</a> on cattle or when it could be used 
        in <a class="italicize">decoration</a> but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely <a class="italicize">uninteresting.</a></p>
    <p> It is evident that is you ask a <span class="question">?</span> you ask a <span class="question">?</span> but anybody who can read at all knows 
        when a <span class="question">?</span> is a <span class="question">?</span> as it is written in writing. 
        Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the <span class="question">?</span> mark.</p> 
        
    <p>Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear 
    and it is therefore like a noun, just an <a class="italicize">unnecessary</a> name of something. A <span class="question">?</span> is a <span class="question">?</span>, anybody 
    can know that a <span class="question">?</span> is a <span class="question">?</span> and so why add to it the <span class="question">?</span> mark when it is already there when 
    the <span class="question">?</span> is already there in the writing. </p>
        
    <p>Therefore I never could bring myself to use a <span class="question">?</span> mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.</p>
