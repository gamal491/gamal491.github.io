<p> Periods have a life of their own a necessity of their own a feeling of their own a time of their own. 
    And that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is 
    the reason that I have always remained true to periods so much so that as I say recently I have felt 
    that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.
<br>
    You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon or a semi-colon.
<br>
<br>
    There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as commas and 
    as such they are <a class="italicize-pink">purely servile </a>or you can think of them as periods and then using them can make you feel 
    <a class="italicize-pink">adventurous</a> I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have, I began unfortunately 
    to feel them as a comma and commas are <a class="italicize-pink">servile</a> they have no life of their own they are <a class="italicize-pink">dependent </a>upon use and 
    convenience and they are put there just for<a class="italicize-pink"> practical purposes.</a>
<br>
<br>
    Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this character the character that a comma has and 
    not the character that a period has and therefore and definitely I have never used them.
</p></div>
    <div class="righttxt">
<p> But now dimly and definitely I do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something 
    of the character of the period and so it might have been an <a class="italicize-pink">adventure </a>to use them.
<br>
<br>
    I really do not think so.
<br>
<br>
    I think however <a class="italicize-pink">lively </a>they are or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period and so really 
    I cannot regret not having used them. 
<br>
    They are more <a class="italicize-pink">powerful </a>more imposing more <a class="italicize-pink">pretentious</a> than a comma but they are a comma all the same.
<br>
    They really have within them deeply within them fundamentally within them the comma nature.
<br>
<br>
    And now what does a comma do and what has it to do and why do I feel as I do about them.</p>
