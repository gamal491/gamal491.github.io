<p class="about">License plates in the United States are known for being different compared to those of other countries. 
    The appearance is unique to each state, differentiated by different symbols, colors, or slogans associated with that issuing state.</p>
<p class="about">The License Plate archive is a collection of the growing dataset of 10 US license plates, 
    categorized by personal preference of most interesting typography and graphic design. 
    It is a time capsule collecting the visual and typographic design choice of each license plate over the past 7 decades from the 1960s to present day.</p> 
<p class="about">Personally, I am a collector of license plates and my fascination with the individualism of each plate that is represented through iconography, typography, and symbolism is what drove my passion for this project.</p>
