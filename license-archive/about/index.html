    License plates in the United States are known for being unique compared to those of other countries. The appearance of license plates is unique to each state, differentiated by different symbols, colors, or slogans associated with the issuing state. 

The License Plate archive is a collection of growing dataset of specifically 20 US license plates, categorized by my personal preference of most interesting typography and graphic design. It is a time capsule collecting the visual and typographic design choice of each license plate over the past 5 decades: 1960s-1970s, 1980s-1990s, and 2000-2020s. 

Personally, I am a collector of license plates, based on each state I travel to and am fascinated by the individualism represented.
